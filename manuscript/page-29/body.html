I cried. "Professor Challenger, the famous zoologist! Wasn't he the man who broke the skull of Blundell, of the Telegraph?"</p><p>The news editor smiled grimly.</p><p>"Do you mind? Didn't you say it was adventures you were after?"</p><p>"It is all in the way of business, sir," I answered.</p><p>"Exactly. I don't suppose he can always be so violent as that. I'm thinking that Blundell got him at the wrong moment, maybe, or in the wrong fashion. You may have better luck, or more tact in handling him. There's something in your line there, I am sure, and the Gazette should work it."</p></div> </div>
