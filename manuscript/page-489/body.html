We were soon to discover that it was not so, and that he was still there upon tolerance.</p><p>It was on the third day after our forming our camp near the Indian caves that the tragedy occurred. Challenger and Summerlee had gone off together that day to the lake where some of the natives, under their direction, were engaged in harpooning specimens of the great lizards.</p></div> </div>
